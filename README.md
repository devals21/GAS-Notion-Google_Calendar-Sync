# GAS-Notion-Google_Calendar-Sync
Here's a new tool that helps keep your Google Calendar and a Notion database in sync. Now, you can turn Notion into a true task manager.

This tool is designed to be easy to set up and works automatically, so you don't have to worry about managing it regularly. It ensures that changes made in your Notion Database or Google Calendar show up in both places.

Using this tool doesn't require any complicated software downloads or running it on your own computer. It's all managed through the Google App Scripts, so you don't need to deal with technical stuff.

This tool can also do special things like automatically update your Notion Database when you change something in your Google Calendar.

Right now, it can handle creating, deleting, and updating events in both your Google Calendar and Notion Database.

## Notion API/Integration Setup
Visit the [Notion integration website](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations) and initiate the creation of a fresh integration. Feel free to choose any name for it, but be certain to choose the appropriate workspace and grant the integration complete content capabilities, without the need for comment capabilities. Once done, you can proceed to submit the integration. Remember to designate the integration as internal and preserve the internal integration token for future use in the setup process.

For your own protection, it's crucial not to disclose this token to anyone else.
